\section{Conclusions}
We have designed \cf, a long-range LTE-based network operating in TVWS. \cf interfaces with a TVWS spectrum database and uses a fully decentralized interference management algorithm that allows for uncoordinated and unplanned deployment but is compatible with the existing LTE network stack. We show the feasibility of \cf using experiments with off-the-shelf LTE equipment. Our extensive simulation results show that \cf improves MAC performance compared to \wf and LTE by reducing the number of starved clients by 70\%-90\%, without affecting the total throughput of the network or penalizing application performance.
